# Hello dear visitor, this is the repository for the User eXperience and Usability Multitouch Questionnaire (UXUMEQ) project.
  UXUMEQ is a questionnaire made to evaluate and help to improve multitouch systems. This repository was created specifically for the artifact presented in the paper "A feasibility study of usability and UX evaluation technologies in
multi-touch context: A quantitative and qualitative analysis" (DOI https://doi.org/10.1145/3613372.3613393).

  UXUMEQ is a technology built to evaluate the UX and Usability of
systems that use multi-touch to perform interactions. The objective
of this technology is to extract quantitative and qualitative data
from the various aspects related to Usability and UX, and it can be used for the evaluation of multi-touch
systems. 

  Questions 1 to 14 address aspects identified as belonging to
Usability, and questions 15 to 27 address aspects identified as being
UX. Each question can be answered quantitatively and qualitatively.

  The quantitative way is through a 5-point semantic differential
scale (1 - totally agree with the left statement; 2 - slightly agree
with the left statement; 3 - neutral point; 4 - slightly agree with
the right statement; 5 - totally agree with the right statement). The
choice of this scale was based on the data returned by the SMS presented on "A systematic mapping study on usability and user eXperience evaluation of multi-touch systems" (DOI https://doi.org/10.1145/3554364.3559131),
where it is evident that the 5-point scale is the most used means of
data collection. 

  Furthermore, next to each end of the scale, some
artifice was inserted to reduce doubts that users may have about
the functioning of the questionnaire. For example, in question 4, the concept of effectiveness is addressed through the
question, "Do you think you were able to reach your goal using
the multi-touch interface?". For this question, it is explained to the
user that choosing a score of 1 is equivalent to not having managed
to achieve the objective, and 5 is equivalent to having managed to
achieve the objective, leaving scores 2, 3, and 4 for the user to define
the nuances between whether or not the objective was achieved.

  The qualitative way of answering each question is presented as a
field where the user can describe the problems he/she has identified
concerning the aspect in question. Observing the qualitative data
collection methods found by the SMS, presented above, such as
interviews and observations of users, it was defined that allowing
the user to explain their experience through the description of the
perceived problems will provide the evaluators with information
that can be used in qualitative analysis methods, such as Grounded
Theory.


The repository is organized with read.me and the licence being presented at the root, and the folders Data From Experiment SBES2023, UXUMEQ Questionnaire and Used Artifacts.
